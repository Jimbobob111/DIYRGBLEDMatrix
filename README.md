# DIYRGBLEDMatrix

Code to run a DIY 5x5 LED matrix, currently using a CD4017 decade counter to scroll through the columns and then turns on the rows as needed for each column. Refresh rate of 1ms, will look into optimizing this as I belive there are a few timing errors which causes the lower rows to be a little dimmer.
